Peer's repository: https://github.com/adsing99/05-Space-shooter-1.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

You can spawn enemies of varying speeds.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 I liked that they used arrow keys for movement instead of the mouse as that made it feel more like a traditional game, and I would like to do that next time.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Make sure that the player can't fly off the screen and get lost by checking for a collision with the screen border.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Perhaps a score indicator or something letting you know your progress in the game.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The code was clear, perhaps a little more time to polish the game itself would've been useful.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 The readme is descriptive and lays out how to play and what the objective is.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

The game is really fluid and I love that all the enemies aren't the same, it keeps the game interesting.
