What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned how to use the spawn function in combination with time.sleep to have enemies constantly spawn. 


What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
In the future I would like to use a position function inside update to get my enemies to move like he did. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
A scoring system could have been included in the code. 
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
It could have been better commented that the enemies would move down the screen if not shot. 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I did not know what .ey and .ex meant in the code. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
It could have been stated how the player takes damage or loses. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Impressive game! The code was very clean without errors and nothing was repetitive. I'm curious to see what else you can do!
